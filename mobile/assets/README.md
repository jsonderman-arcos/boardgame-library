# Assets

This directory contains app assets like icons and splash screens.

## Required Assets

To run the app, you'll need to add the following files:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen (1284x2778px for iOS)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

## Generating Assets

You can use online tools or design software to create these assets:

1. Create a 1024x1024px icon with your app branding
2. Use [Expo's icon generator](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/app-icons/) for proper sizing
3. Place the generated files in this directory

## Placeholder Assets

For development, you can use simple colored squares as placeholders. The app will still run without these assets, but you'll see warnings in the console.
