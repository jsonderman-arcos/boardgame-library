## Quick Reference: The Three Arrays

Think of them this way:

```
🎲 Game: "Pandemic"

game_category (Theme):
  - Medical
  - Science Fiction
  - Racing

game_mechanism (How to Play):
  - Cooperative Play
  - Hand Management
  - Point to Point Movement
  - Set Collection
  - Trading

game_type (Broader Classification):
  - Cooperative Games
  - Medical: Diseases
  - Pandemic
```

## Database Schema

These fields map to your Supabase `shared_games` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shared_games (
  ...
  game_type text[],        -- Families/series
  game_category text[],    -- Themes
  game_mechanism text[],   -- Gameplay mechanics
  ...
);
```

## UI Display Suggestions

### Game Card Display
```tsx
{/* Show category as theme tags */}
{game.game_category?.map(cat => (
  <span className="badge badge-theme">{cat}</span>
))}

{/* Show mechanics as gameplay tags */}
{game.game_mechanism?.map(mech => (
  <span className="badge badge-mechanic">{mech}</span>
))}
```

### Filtering
- **Browse by Theme** → Use `game_category`
- **Browse by Mechanic** → Use `game_mechanism`
- **Browse by Series** → Use `game_type`

## Example Response

Here's what a full BGG lookup returns for "Wingspan":

```json

  ],

  "game_mechanism": [
    "Card Drafting",
    "Dice Rolling",
    "End Game Bonuses",
    "Hand Management",
    "Set Collection"

  "game_type": [
    "Animals: Birds",
    "Tableau Building Games",
    "Components: Cards"
  ],

  "description": "Wingspan is a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven..."
}
```

## Using in Your App

### Barcode Scanning
When a user scans a barcode, all these fields are automatically fetched and stored:

```typescript
const gameData = await lookupBarcodeWithBgg(barcode);
// Returns full data including categories, mechanics, and types
```

### Filtering Example
```typescript
// Filter by mechanic
const deckBuilders = library.filter(entry =>
  entry.game.game_mechanism?.includes('Deck Building')
);

// Filter by category
const fantasyGames = library.filter(entry =>
  entry.game.game_category?.includes('Fantasy')
);
```

## Rate Limiting Considerations

BGG's XML API has rate limits. Our Edge Function helps by:
- Centralizing all requests
- Making it easy to add caching later
- Tracking usage in one place

Consider adding database caching:
1. Check if game exists with BGG ID
2. If yes, return cached data
3. If no, call BGG API and cache result
4. Only re-fetch if data is old (e.g., > 30 days)
